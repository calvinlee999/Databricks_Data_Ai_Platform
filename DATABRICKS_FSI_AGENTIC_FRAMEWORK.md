# Databricks Financial Services: The Agentic Shift Framework

## Executive Summary

The financial services industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation from basic Generative AI "co-pilots" to autonomous AI agents that can fundamentally **"Change the Bank."** This document outlines Databricks' strategic framework for Financial Services Institutions (FSI) to evolve into "Agentic Institutions" through a structured approach to AI adoption.

**Key Insight:** While 80% of firms have implemented co-pilots, 95% see zero returns. The path to value lies in moving up the AI maturity curve through strategic agentic infrastructure deployment.
